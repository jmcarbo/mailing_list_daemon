TODO

Possible enhancements in the order of priority:

- Try use <postmaster@[ip-address]> as FROM is not good (spf softfail), use original domain (from config)

- Remove succesfully sent messages

- Process retry and bounce

- Add AccessControl, allow relay to any address from allowed IP and FROM address

- Allow pass-through of mails sent to "postmaster"

- Research anti-spam protocols including SPF, X-Originating-IP and Sender (RFC5322)

- Try to use non-root user for better security:

- Implement SIZE (RFC1870)

- Implement STARTTLS (RFC3207)

- Consider using Lua as a configuration language:
