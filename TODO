Possible improvements (in order of priority):
 
- Add Outbound Relay option so that all mails are relayed instead of delivered to destination directly

- Change RelayCtrl format, allow relay to any address from allowed IP or domain etc.

- Process SIGHUP

- Consider prevention of loopholes in configuration file

Further improvements (no plan for implementation yet):

- While reporting error by bounce message, consider link the address to its original list name

- Implement AUTH (RFC2554)

- Implement SIZE (RFC1870) (for auditing and usage count etc.)

- Implement client side (outbound) STARTTLS (ref. net/smtp)

- Implement server side (inbound) STARTTLS (RFC3207)

- Implement 8BITMIME (RFC1652)

- Try to use non-root user for better security:

- Implement content scanning and filtering interface

- detatch from terminal on start

- Improve syslog4g to allow prioritized log messages (i.e. use different facilities to allow different rotating strategy)

- Consider using Lua as a configuration language:

- Implement multi-language template for bounce messages
